# Security trainings

This repository presents some examples of security incident response / investigation.

The trainings from this repository are for beginners and focus on the perspective of Operating Systems concepts.


When investigating a system, we are mainly looking at the system's anomalies.
Mainly, we are focusing out analysis on the following OS resources:
  - system calls - gives an overview of what the system is running (can be too verbose); filtering may be needed.
  - processes - we can see what processes are running in the system and find the ones that do not fit with the server activity.
  - memory - when needed, inspect the memory of a running process to see what it does.
  - disk / file system - file system changes may indicate malicious activity.
  - network connections - track suspicious connections.
  - configuration files - bad configurations can lead to security issues.
  - services/applications - odd applications may be indicators of compromise
  - how tools are used - legitimate tools ca be used to launch attacks.
